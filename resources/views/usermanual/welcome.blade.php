<div class="col-6">There have many waste management system around the world <br>Main theme of those system is business, the collect waste and recycle waste
make profit from it.<br> It’s not solution of waste collect and clean environment .
  Some of them collected solid waste , but waste are not only solid , there are
also liquid .<br>
  They collect waste everyday , but it’s not a real solution . because sometime
they would be serve emergency . <br>Sometime waste bin is full , then people
can’t keep waste in the bin, they keep it near the bin on the street .

<div class="col-6">Studying Some physical system of Waste management System we find out some problem . <br>
  Employees heading for their workstations every morning. For all those people<br> there are just
not enough garbage bins available.<br> On the streets of urban cities, hundreds of people are 
<br>Passing the same location around one minute.
The obvious solution to this is for the cleaning staff to stay near garbage bins every day till<br>
they fill up to clean them. This is not a real solution.
There are some notable negative effects when considering the garbage bins always being full.<br>
One of the main effects is the surrounding area starting to smell and be very unpleasant.
When<br>
The garbage bins are full people put their trash on sides of the garbage bins.
